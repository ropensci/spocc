Docs: <https://docs.ropensci.org/spocc/>

At rOpenSci, we have been writing R packages to interact with many sources of species occurrence data, including [GBIF][gbif], [Vertnet][vertnet], [iNaturalist][inat], and [eBird][ebird]. Other databases are out there as well, which we can pull in. `spocc` is an R package to query and collect species occurrence data from many sources. The goal is to to create a seamless search experience across data sources, as well as creating unified outputs across data sources.

`spocc` currently interfaces with seven major biodiversity repositories

1. [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)][gbif] (via `rgbif`)
GBIF is a government funded open data repository with several partner organizations with the express goal of providing access to data on Earth's biodiversity. The data are made available by a network of member nodes, coordinating information from various participant organizations and government agencies.

2. [iNaturalist][inat]
iNaturalist provides access to crowd sourced citizen science data on species observations.

3. [VertNet][vertnet] (via `rvertnet`)
Similar to `rgbif` (see below), VertNet provides access to more than 80 million vertebrate records spanning a large number of institutions and museums primarly covering four major disciplines (mammology, herpetology, ornithology, and icthyology).

4. [eBird][ebird] (via `rebird`)
ebird is a database developed and maintained by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the National Audubon Society. It provides real-time access to checklist data, data on bird abundance and distribution, and communtiy reports from birders.

5. [iDigBio][idigbio] (via `ridigbio`)
iDigBio facilitates the digitization of biological and paleobiological specimens and their associated data, and houses specimen data, as well as providing their specimen data via RESTful web services.

6. [OBIS][obis]
OBIS (Ocean Biogeographic Information System) allows users to search marine species datasets from all of the world's oceans.

7. [Atlas of Living Australia][ala]
ALA (Atlas of Living Australia) contains information on all the known species in Australia aggregated from a wide range of data providers: museums, herbaria, community groups, government departments, individuals and universities; it contains more than 50 million occurrence records.

The inspiration for this comes from users requesting a more seamless experience across data sources, and from our work on a similar package for taxonomy data ([taxize][taxize]).

__BEWARE:__ In cases where you request data from multiple providers, especially when including GBIF, there could be duplicate records since many providers' data eventually ends up with GBIF. See `?spocc_duplicates`, after installation, for more.

## Installation

Stable version from CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spocc", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Or the development version from GitHub

```{r eval=FALSE}

## Make maps

All mapping functionality is now in a separate package [mapr](https://github.com/ropensci/mapr) (formerly known as `spoccutils`), to make `spocc` easier to maintain. `mapr` [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mapr).
