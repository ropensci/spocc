One problem you often run in to is that there can be various names for the same taxon in any one source. For example:


```r
library(spocc)
df <- occ(query = 'Pinus contorta', from = c('gbif', 'idigbio'), limit = 50)
unique(df$gbif$data$Pinus_contorta$name)
#> [1] "Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon"     
#> [2] "Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm."
#> [3] "Pinus contorta var. contorta"
unique(df$idigbio$data$Pinus_contorta$name)
#> [1] "pinus contorta"
```

This is fine, but when trying to make a map in which points are colored for each taxon, you can have many colors for a single taxon, where instead one color per taxon is more appropriate. There is a function in `scrubr` called `fix_names()`, which has a few options in which you can take the shortest names (usually just the plain binomials like _Homo sapiens_), or the original name queried, or a vector of names supplied by the user. `scrubr` is no longer maintained and no longer on CRAN, but you can get the package on GitHub at <https://github.com/ropensci-archive/scrubr>.
